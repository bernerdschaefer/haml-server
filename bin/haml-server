# **haml-server** is a dead-simple Sinatra app for serving up a directory of
# files. There are a few other projects much more ambitious than this (such as
# [serve][1]), but haml-server's goal is simple: serve haml files. Why? Because
# writing `HTML` is a pain -- especially when you're just putting together a
# prototype, or, say, testing out some javascript behavior.

#### Installation

# This is the easy part! Run this from your default ruby (or default RVM ruby)
# so you have access to `haml-server` from wherever you are.
#
#     gem install haml-server
#
# You can also grab the code from [github][1].
#
# [1]: https://github.com/bernerdschaefer/haml-server

#### Usage

# Think of `haml-server` as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`... but for `HAML`!
#
#     haml-server # serves the current directory at localhost:4567
#     haml-server . # ^ same as above
#     haml-server -p 8000 sub/dir
#
# Visiting `http://localhost:4567/` will render `index.haml`. Visiting
# `/path/to/resource` will render `path/to/resource.haml`. Simple.

##### Layouts

# You can also create a file called `layout.haml` to apply a layout to each of
# your pages:
#
#     # layout.haml
#     %html
#       %body
#         = yield

##### SASS

# If you want to use SASS templates, you can either define them inline using
# HAML's filters, like so:
#
#     # index.haml
#     %html
#       %head
#         :sass
#           .content
#             width: 10px
#
# Or you can write them to a standalone file, and then link to the same file
# but with ".css" instead of ".sass". So if you had `/stylesheets/screen.sass`,
# then you might do this in your layout:
#
#     # layout.haml
#     %html
#       %head
#         :css
#           @import url(/stylesheets/screen.css);

##### Helpers

# You can create a file called `helpers.rb` to define any helpers you might
# want to make available.
#
#     # helpers.rb
#     require "pygmentize"
#
#     def highlight(code, format)
#       Pygmentize.process(code, format)
#     end
#
#     alias hi highlight
#
# And then in your views, you can access the helpers:
#
#     # index.haml
#
#     %h3 Example code
#     ~ hi "puts '1 + 2 # => 3'", :ruby
#
# The helpers are reloaded before each request, so you can add and remove them
# without restarting the server.

#### The code

# `HAML`, check!
require "haml"

# `SASS`, check!
require "sass"

# Okay. In any other context, this would be pretty evil. Let me explain.
# Sinatra is a well-behaving citizen, and calls `ARGV.dup` before parsing its
# options.  Unfortunately for us, that means if we want to easily add
# additional arguments, we either have to 1) re-parse `ARGV` (which would mean
# copying the options from `sinatra/main.rb`) or 2) just redefine `ARGV.dup`.
# Should be clear which one I prefer.
def ARGV.dup
  self
end

# Yep. This is a hack, too. Sinatra only automatically runs itself when the
# file is directly called -- but that's not the case when running through
# rubygem's wrapped command. Solution? Just pretend we were executed directly.
$0 = __FILE__

# And now we can load sinatra, knowing that the options will be parsed out of
# `ARGV` and the server will start automatically.
require "sinatra"

# I love Pathname. This line works just like you'd expect it to:
#
#     Pathname("/data/foo") + "." # => /data/foo
#     Pathname("/data/foo") + "../" # => /data
#     Pathname("/data/foo") + "/data" # => /data
#
require "pathname"

template_dir = Pathname(Dir.pwd) + (ARGV.shift || ".")

set :public_folder, template_dir
set :views, template_dir

# If a favicon wasn't already matched by the public handler, just return a 404.
get "/favicon.ico" do
  404
end

# This will be a container module for user-defined helpers. `Helpers.reload!`
# will clean up any existing methods in the module, and then load helpers
# defined in a `helpers.rb` file if it exists.
module Helpers
  class << self
    def reload!
      # First we remove all instance methods in the helper module.
      instance_methods.each do |method|
        remove_method(method)
      end

      # And now we load any helper methods into the module from the file
      # `helpers.rb` if it exists.
      module_eval(File.read("helpers.rb")) if File.file?("helpers.rb")
    end
  end
end

# Include our module into the Sinatra application.
helpers Helpers

# This is our basic handler for all requests that come through to Sinatra.
# We'll extract the necessary path information, and then render either a haml
# or sass file.
handler = lambda do

  # Reload our helpers for each request.
  Helpers.reload!

  path = request.path_info

  extension = File.extname(path)

  # This is the most straight-forward way to remove the extension from a while
  # while preserving it's original path information.
  path = path.chomp(extension)

  # If the path is empty, it's a request for the index page.
  path = :index if path == "/"

  # We're rendering templates, so we need to convert to a symbol for Sinatra --
  # otherwise it will think we're rending a string.
  path = path.to_sym

  case extension
  when ".css"
    # If a request for, say, '/stylesheets/screen.css' wasn't matched by the
    # public handler, then we try to render a sass template with the same name.
    sass path
  else
    # Otherwise, we fall back to always rendering haml.
    haml path
  end
end

# Now we bind our handler to all of the `HTTP` verbs. Matching against `//` is
# shorthand for matching all request paths: since `//` always returns true when
# matched against a string, our handler will run on every request. We could
# also write `get %r{/(.*)}, &handler`.. but that just looks ugly!
get    //, &handler
put    //, &handler
post   //, &handler
delete //, &handler

# And that's it! We let Sinatra handle the rest: it will parse out any provided
# options (see `haml-server -h`) and then run the server for us.
